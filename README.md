# intelligent-search-gpt4-mini

A web application integrating intelligent search using OpenAI's GPT-4-mini model. The backend is powered by Java (Spring Boot) and Maven, while the frontend is built using Next.js and React. This project demonstrates seamless interaction between modern AI and a full-stack web application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Java 21** or higher.
- **Node.js 20.x** (ensure compatibility with your environment).
- **Maven 3.6.3** or higher.

## Getting Started

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsWaqar963/intelligent-search-gpt4-mini.git
   cd intelligent-search-gpt4-mini
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd gpt4iwithreact
   ```

3. Build and run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The backend will be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend (Next.js)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the frontend.

## Project Structure

- **Backend:** The backend is a Spring Boot application configured using Maven. It integrates OpenAI's GPT-4-mini model to process intelligent search requests.
  
- **Frontend:** The frontend is built using Next.js and React. It communicates with the backend to fetch and display search results dynamically.

## Additional Information

### Maven `pom.xml`
The `pom.xml` includes dependencies for:
- `spring-boot-starter-web` for building RESTful services.
- `spring-ai-openai-spring-boot-starter` for integrating with OpenAI's services.
- `spring-boot-starter-test` for testing.

### `package.json`
The `package.json` file in the frontend includes scripts for development, build, and start using Next.js.
